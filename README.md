# Neural Network Project with TensorFlow

## Introduction

This repository contains an introductory project focused on developing and training neural networks. We use TensorFlow, a powerful library for machine learning, to build and train a neural network model. The model consists of two dense layers and is trained using the famous MNIST dataset, which comprises 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the fundamentals of neural network construction, training, and evaluation using TensorFlow. This includes:

- **Model Construction**: Building a neural network model with dense layers.
- **Data Handling**: Loading and preprocessing data from the MNIST dataset.
- **Model Training**: Training the model on the MNIST training data.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model on unseen test data.
